1. Introduction
The Health Monitoring System is a secure, user-friendly web-based application that allows users to input and track their health data such as heart rate, blood pressure, sugar level, and temperature. The system simulates real-time monitoring through manual input and provides features like data visualization, health alerts, trend analysis, an AI health assistant bot, and report generation.
Unlike traditional systems, this project emphasizes interactivity, professional dashboard design, and smart assistance, making it both beginner-friendly for learning CRUD operations and advanced with dashboard + AI assistant features.
